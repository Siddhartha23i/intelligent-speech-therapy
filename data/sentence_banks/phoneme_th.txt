Think about the three things.
The mother and father gathered together.
Although the weather was thick with thunder.
Throw the ball through the hoop.
Thursday is the fourth day.
Thirty-three thousand feathers on a thrush's throat.
The thin thistle seems thoroughly thick.
Theo threw three free throws.
Beneath the smooth south wind.
They thanked them for their thoughtful gifts.
Martha's birthday is the third of the month.
Both thieves were thoroughly thankful.
Thoughtful Thelma thanked them warmly.
Throughout the month they gathered monthly.
Theresa thinks things through thoroughly.
The mythical python is rather lethal.
Thirsty athletes gathered by the fountain.
Something bothers my brother Theodore.
The youthful author wrote monthly.
Mathematicians think through everything methodically.
